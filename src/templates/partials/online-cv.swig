								<strong>Havas Worldwide</strong>
								<div class="role">Front-End Developer</div>
								<div class="date">Jul 2014 – Sep 2014</div>
								<p>
									Contracted to retro-fit responsive web design (RWD) into <a class="ext-link" data-url="http://www.ellaskitchen.co.uk">ellaskitchen.co.uk</a>. I was responsible for detailed analysis of custom WordPress theme templates, UX design, HTML and CSS structure to identify design patterns and develop solutions to display content effectively as the viewport size decreased, preserving the ‘hand-drawn’ design style on tablet &amp; mobile devices. I converted the existing vanilla CSS to SCSS and developed mixins to optimise CSS generation for use within media queries; automated asset creation using Photoshop; wrote basic jQuery scripts to avoid WordPress template modification before re-platforming and participated in the successful deployment of the new code. The contract was extended for six weeks and I worked alongside the dev team to build new content including campaigns to promote <a class="ext-link" data-url="http://www.ellaskitchen.co.uk/stuff-for-the-senses/good-snacking-kids/">healthy snacks</a> and recycling involving extensive use of sprite sheets, jQuery UI components and a modular workflow using Grunt and Bower. Throughout this contract I developed my knowledge of Git via the terminal and gained more experience working with Grunt.

								<strong>Fabric World Wide</strong>
								<div class="role">Front-End Developer</div>
								<div class="date">Feb 2014 – Jun 2014</div>
								<p>
									Initially a two month contract to build the <a class="ext-link" data-url="http://www.oldmoutcider.co.uk/">Old Mout Cider UK website</a>, a sub-brand of Heineken. My role involved working closely with the design team, back &amp; front-end developers and dev-ops to plan, build, test and deploy the website. The site needed to be viewed on desktop and mobile so I selected the Foundation 5 framework to provide a useful starting point for the mobile-first responsive, fluid layout. I used Sass to manage the complex CSS media queries and worked alongside another front-end developer to add progressive enhancement to the UX using jQuery. The contract was extended when a competition linked with the Old Mout UK Facebook site was required. I was also involved on other projects including working with a Java developer to convert the <a class="ext-link" data-url="http://www.kfc.co.uk/about-kfc/contact-us/contact-us-form">KFC UK website contact form</a> to post data to external REST API methods. My role at Fabric involved daily ‘stand-ups’ and interaction with all members of the development team though which I gained experience working in an agile environment on large-scale projects. I also gained experience working with issue tracking tools (JIRA), source control (git, BitBucket/GitHub), cross browser/device/OS testing (browser dev tools, SauceLabs, BrowserStack, virtual machines, iOS &amp; Android emulators) and modern development workflow tools including Bower &amp; Grunt.

								<strong>Worth Interactive</strong>
								<div class="role">Front-End Developer (Freelance)</div>
								<div class="date">Jan 2002 - May 2003</div>
								<p>
									Contracted by this digital agency based in Richmond to build their corporate website and accompanying CD ROM. A ‘space station’ concept was developed with several interactive modules representing the various sectors of the group. Working closely with the design layouts from the creative team, I developed a unique, highly interactive UI/UX in Flash MX that could be explored and deconstructed. The majority of animation was scripted resulting in smaller file sizes and an increase in scalability. Following completion, my contract was extended and I continued to work on various other agency web design and development projects including TDK systems &amp; Kingston Communications.

								<strong>Citibank</strong>
								<div class="role">Front-End Developer (Freelance)</div>
								<div class="date">Jan 2001 – Dec 2001</div>
								<p>
									Contracted as team leader to develop interactive training material for CitiDirect, Citibank’s premier online banking system. Following 3 years developing CitiDirect and migrating legacy systems, innovative, interactive training software was required to replace current outdated material to encourage Citibank’s customers to ‘self-train’, drastically reducing the cost of current ‘one-on-one’ training. The brief was to design and develop a system for delivery both by CD ROM and online. I designed the information architecture to be driven by XML files that customise all menus, regions, products and languages. This approach is scalable and easy to customise by non-skilled personnel. I designed the content in the form of modular, animated procedures derived from screen cams taken from the CitiDirect software. The system was partnered with comprehensive PDF guides which I designed and produced in QuarkXPress. As team leader, my responsibilities included the recruitment and management of two Flash developers and two desktop publishers.
