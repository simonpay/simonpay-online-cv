Having already produced an Andorid app, the Gluru team wanted to offer a responsive web app to provide enhanced features to both desktop and mobile users. I was recruited to build the html &amp; css for the user interface. I worked closely with the graphic designer to convert of the newly designed multiple psd files into a working prototype with production-ready html &amp; css code. I employed a modular approach to SASS authoring based on a customised version of BEM methodology to build the various components of the app, abstracting components to their most basic function keeping file size to a minimum whilst maximising scalability and efficiency. Initially a six week contract, the position was extended to 3 months. Company investors then changed focus leading to a requirement for another Angular specialist to continue.</p>"

I converted the existing vanilla CSS to SCSS and developed mixins to optimise CSS generation for use within media queries; automated asset creation using Photoshop; wrote basic jQuery scripts to avoid WordPress template modification before re-platforming and participated in the successful deployment of the new code.

My role involved working closely with the design team, back &amp; front-end developers and dev-ops to plan, build, test and deploy the website. The site needed to be viewed on desktop and mobile so I selected the Foundation 5 framework to provide a useful starting point for the mobile-first responsive, fluid layout. I used Sass to manage the complex CSS media queries and worked alongside another front-end developer to add progressive enhancement to the UX using jQuery. The contract was extended when a competition linked with the Old Mout UK Facebook site was required. I was also involved on other projects including working with a Java developer to convert the <a class=\"ext-link\" data-url=\"http://www.kfc.co.uk/about-kfc/contact-us/contact-us-form\">KFC UK website contact form</a> to post data to external REST API methods. My role at Fabric involved daily ‘stand-ups’ and interaction with all members of the development team though which I gained experience working in an agile environment on large-scale projects. I also gained experience working with issue tracking tools (JIRA), source control (git, BitBucket/GitHub), cross browser/device/OS testing (browser dev tools, SauceLabs, BrowserStack, virtual machines, iOS &amp; Android emulators) and modern development workflow tools including Bower &amp; Grunt.</p>"
