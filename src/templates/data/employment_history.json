I was recruited to build the user interface <span class=\"tech\">HTML &amp; CSS</span> for a responsive web app to complement their existing Android app. I worked closely with a graphic designer and Angular developer to convert psd files into a <a class=\"icon-link js-link\" data-url=\"/examples/gluru/moments-daily-digest-first-run.html\" title=\"View the prototype\">working prototype</a>, with production-ready code for the Angular developer to integrate into the web app. I built the interface from scratch, setting up an efficient workflow based on <span class=\"tech\">Grunt</span>, <span class=\"tech\">Assemble</span> and <span class=\"tech\">Compass</span> to compile the files and create the retina-optimised sprite sheets. I employed a <span class=\"tech\">modular approach</span> to <span class=\"tech\">SASS</span> authoring based on a customised version of <span class=\"tech\">BEM methodology</span>. I abstracted modules to their basic function for re-use, minimising file size whilst maximising scalability &amp; efficiency. I used <span class=\"tech\">Swig</span> (a JavaScript template engine) to build the structure of the demo and replicated the data that would be received from API calls using static <span class=\"tech\">JSON</span> files. I wrote a library of <span class=\"tech\">jQuery methods</span> to handle the interactions required to navigate the interface and perform functions to create a realistic user experience for the demo. I also set up an efficient Grunt workflow for the production of <span class=\"tech\">HTML emails</span> and developed responsive templates using <span class=\"tech\">Zurb Ink</span>, testing them across email clients using <span class=\"tech\">Litmus</span>. Initially a six week contract, the position was extended to 3 months. Due to short timeframes, the responsive element of the build wasn't implemented beyond a basic starting point.</p>",
